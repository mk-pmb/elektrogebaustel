DFG 01-093
==========

"DFG" is the company name, "Deutsche Fernsprecher Gesellschaft",
which roughly translates to "German telephone corporation",
except "telephone" is too casual, doesn't convey the vintageness
and stiffness of "Fernsprecher".
It was founded in 1914.

  * This one looks exactly like the one I have, except mine has the actual
    "DFG 01-093" branding on the silver label, so for that one I can actually
    confirm the model number.
